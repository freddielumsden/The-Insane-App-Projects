# The-Insane-App-Projects
This repo's purpose is to give me  experience with programming with python, and give proof to others of my experience, for freelancing etc. I am getting the ideas from a website, specifically - https://www.theinsaneapp.com/2021/06/list-of-python-projects-with-source-code-and-tutorials.html.
